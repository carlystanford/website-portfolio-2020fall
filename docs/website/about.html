      <p style="position: absolute; TOP: 275px; LEFT: 560px; color:black;font-size;50px;">Hi There!</p>
      <p style="position: absolute; TOP: 315px; LEFT: 560px; color:black;font-size:20px;">My name is Carly, I'm a senior at the University of Pittsburgh, and I love to </br> bake.
        I started baking when I was in middle school, and I was mostly drawn </br> to it because of my huge sweet tooth. I will choose something
        sweet over </br> something savory or salty 9 times out of 10, so my initial motivation for </br> baking was just the end product. I started simple, with box mixes </br> and
        pre-made doughs before learning how to make things from scratch. </br> Now, I not only enjoy the end product of baking, but the process as well. I </br> find it meditative to throw
        on a good playlist or podcast episode and get to </br> work mixing, kneading, or rolling.
        My favorite things to bake are those that </br> have simple techniques, but interesting ingredients or flavor profiles. Some</br>of my inspirations and favorite places to get
        recipes are <a href="https://www.butterandbrioche.com/">Butter and Brioche</a>,</br><a href="https://thecinnaman.com/">the Cinnaman</a>, and <a href="https://www.bonappetit.com/">Bon Appetit</a>.
         Here youâ€™ll find just a small collection of</br>some of my creations. Enjoy!
